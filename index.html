								<h3>We’re a small, <br/><span>independent publisher...<span></h3>
								<p>These are things we're proud of, and we don't have any plans to change. Being small helps us have a personal connection to the work we produce, and being independent allows us full license in publishing the types of books we want, for the reasons we believe in. We're family. We're a team. We're passionate about what we do.<p>

								<p>We're always open to new authors and projects, but we take on new projects intentionally, ensuring we are always able to provide continued support to our existing community of authors — to help them grow, challenge themselves, and live their purpose.</p>

								<p>Another thing we're proud of, that we don't see changing any time soon.<p>

								<p>Austin is a wonderfully inspiring city packed with creative minds that constantly push one to do more, better. Our goal is to work with Austin-based authors and creatives and help them bring a bit of the charm, free-thinking, and weirdness of our Big Little Town to the rest of the world. While Impetus is assisted by folks from a variety of geolocations, the Austin spirit burns bright in all of us.<p>

								<h3>Meet author <br/><span>Dr. Karen Rayne...<span></h3>
								<p>Dr. Karen Rayne began her work in education almost two decades ago and her work with parents of teenagers almost ten years ago. Since then she has been working in her local community, as well as nationally and internationally, to support parent-teen conversations about sex and sexuality. She has worked with parents, youth, and professionals on this topic. Her primary goal is to support families in building relationships that hold solid and true from the fun times through the hard times and everything in between. Sexuality is all of these things, and so conversations about them must also be.</p>

								<h3>&amp; his book <br/><span>A Guide to Gender.<span></h3>
								<p><em><a href="http://guidetogender.com" alt="A Guide to Gender">The Social Justice Advocate's Handbook: A Guide to Gender</a></em> is, as the title suggests, a guide to gender from a social justice perspective. But it's much more than that. It's a couple hundred pages of gender exploration, social justice how-tos, practical resources, and fun graphics &amp; comics.</p>

								<p>Killermann offers clear, easily-digested, and practical explanations of one of the most commonly misunderstood things about people. It's a book about gender with no mention of the word hegemony, but plenty of relatable stories, metaphors, and references that will keep you turning the page as you learn how much you misunderstood something we all think we get: gender.<p>
